Day 1\. Morning 1\. 

The page turns to a new chapter. 

"The intrepid explorer pushes off the dock, brings up the sail, and starts off into the great unknown."

Or something like that.

I have a great feeling. Something tells me that I am going to enjoy this. Something tells me that I am going to learn a lot, and have a great time doing it. 

And that's a great feeling. No fear (yet) about being in too deep without a life jacket. Well, I should probably knock on some wood.
