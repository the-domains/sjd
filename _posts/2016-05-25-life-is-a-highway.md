Life is a highway.

Once the sun has come up, the road is open. Thankfully there is no traffic. You can drive in whatever direction you wish, at the speed you wish.

Sometimes you want to go fast. Sometimes you want to go slow. Sometimes you want to stop and take a break, or check out an interesting small town along the route.

I need to go faster. Too much time exploring the same old local town, such that it has become too comfortable and too familiar. Not saying that I'm looking forward to being uncomfortable, but I am looking forward to going fast again. I'm looking forward to new heights and new vistas. 

Maybe the local town is the best town there is? It's quite possible. Can I explore farther afield while still resting my head at night in my familiar bed? Probably not. But can I come back to the local town after a few months of exploring farther places? I sure can.

Let's get on the road and drive.
